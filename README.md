# MoodStream AI

MoodStream AI is an AI-driven entertainment recommendation platform that delivers personalized suggestions for movies, TV shows, and video games. The project is organized with a FastAPI backend and a V0-based frontend.

The backend can be deployed as a serverless function on Vercel using the files in
the `api/` directory.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide your API keys before running locally.

See `PRD.md` for the full product requirements document.
